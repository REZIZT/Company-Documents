## Conflicts of interest

## Key filing dates

The Company Secretary informed the Directors that:
- the accounts for the period 7 September 2017 to 30 September 2018 are due by 7 June 2019 in physical form;

**The Directors resolved** that the Company Secretary will maintain the company accounts and be responsible for filing the accounts, confirmation statements and CIC Report.

The Company Secretary reminded the Directors that the CIC Report should be completed by the Directors, though it will be filed on their behalf by the Company Secretary.

## Statutory registers

The Company Secretary reminded the Directors that the Company is required to maintain statutory registers containing information about Members, Directors and Company Secretaries.

The Company Secretary raised the issue of maintaining statutory registers via a specialist third-party, or maintaining registers on a secure, UK-accessible server.

The Directors considered that:
- the information kept in the registers had already been provided to the British Government;
- the information is already, to some extent, on the public record;
- regardless of whether the information stored by specialist third-party service or on a secure server, it requires trusting a third-party with the data; and
- that Inform Direct (https://www.informdirect.co.uk) is a convenient and reputable service provider that can ensure the Company meets the legal requirements.

**The Directors resolved** that the Company Secretary will maintain the Company registers using Inform Direct.

## Revenue and Customs registration

The Company Secretary informed the Directors that company tax registration with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is required within three months of commencing business.

**The Directors resolved** that the Company Secretary will register the Company for company tax as soon as possible.

## Financial matters

The Company Secretary:
- acknowledged that there had been informal discussions about using the Co-operative Bank (https://www.co-operativebank.co.uk) for bank accounts; and
- brought attention to the issue of potential incompatibility with residency requirements.

**The Directors resolved** that each would look into options for banking in the United Kingdom and return to the issue at the next meeting.

The Directors acknowledged that although it is undesirable to use PayPal for storing funds, it is likely necessary to maintain a PayPal account for sending and receiving money.

**The Directors resolved** that the Company Secretary will set up the Company's PayPal account.

## Domain ownership and email addresses

**The Directors resolved** that the Company Secretary will arrange for the transfer of ownership of the domain 'RZZT.io' to the Company.

The Company Secretary raised the option of using Zoho (https://www.zoho.com) as an email provider.

Akhilesh was opposed to using Zoho from personal experience. The Directors discussed self-managing email services, but rejected this due to high costs and potential maintenance burden.

**The Directors resolved** that each would look into options for email providers and return to the issue at the next meeting.
