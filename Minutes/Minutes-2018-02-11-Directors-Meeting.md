The Directors confirmed that the requirement of seven clear days' notice for Directors' meetings was met, notice of the meeting being given on [Sunday 28 January 2018](https://github.com/RZZT/Company-Documents/blob/master/Minutes/Minutes-2018-01-28-Directors-Meeting.md).

## Taskhive Progress

The Directors noted that the Taskhive project alpha version was nearly complete and ready for testing.

## Membership acquisition

- The Directors noted that the current number of members is an even number (six) and that this is undesirable because:
    - the total number of members does not outweigh the total number of Directors, who are also currently members, meaning that the members would not be able to exercise their reserve power effectively; and
    - an even number of members can result in an equality of votes.
- Matthew noted that this should not lead to increasing membership for the sake of it.

## Next Meeting

The next meeting will be on Sunday 18 February 2018 at 02:30 UTC±0.

## Close of Meeting

The meeting was closed at 02:46 UTC±0.
