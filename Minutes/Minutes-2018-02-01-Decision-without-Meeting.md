# Minute of resolution regarding Funding Committee — 2018-02-01

On Thursday 1 February 2018 at 21:27 UTC±0 the Directors resolved to amend the [Funding Committee Terms of Reference](https://github.com/RZZT/Company-Documents/blob/master/Committee%20Terms%20of%20Reference/funding-committee.md) by:

1. replacing the words 'a person with sufficient expertise on free software and open source projects' with 'one or more persons who are part of the free software and open source community';
2. inserting a new item in the membership list which reads 'any other person that may be necessary, as determined by the Directors'; and
3. inserting a new section after 'Membership' titled 'Leadership', with the text 'The funding committee shall be led by the Funding Officer, who shall be the Director appointed to the funding committee in that capacity.'
