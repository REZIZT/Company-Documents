## Funding Committee progress

The Funding Committee was directed to provide a progress report to the Directors.

## PayPal access

- The Directors noted that having multiple people be able to access the Company's PayPal account was desirable.
- The Company Secretary confirmed that multi-user access to PayPal is possible and can be arranged.

## Taskhive developer contracts and payment

- Matthew noted that Victor is currently the lead developer on the Taskhive project, which the Company has resolved to fund pending the negotiation and entering into of a contract with a developer.
- Matthew proposed that the Company negotiate a contract with Victor given his familiarity with and knowledge of the Taskhive project.
- The Directors acknowledged that Victor has a conflict of interest in this matter and is not permitted to vote.
- In the absence of Akhilesh, the matter was deferred until such time as a valid decision could be made.

## Meeting times and dates

- The Directors noted that Akhilesh had previously suggested the meetings be moved either to Sundays at 14:00 or 15:00 UTC±0.
- Victor suggested the meetings be moved to the same day at 16:00 or 17:00 UTC±0.
- Mozart reminded the Directors that either option would be early Monday morning for him, thus precluding his attendance.
- Matthew stated his indifference to the particular date and time, but wanted it to remain at a given date and time for a substantial period of time.

## Communications platforms

- Mike suggested the Company switch to a communications platform other than Slack or IRC.
- Mike stated he would be able to present some options to the Board at the next meeting.
- Mike noted that alternatives would require the Company to self-host the platforms, and offered to host these on behalf of the Company.

Mike brought up the suggestion of alternative communications platforms to use and indicated he would have choices presented to the board to be decided on prior to the end of the next meeting. Mike also mentioned the idea of being required to self-host the servers required for these communications platforms, and offered to provide RZZT with them.

## Next meeting
