In accordance with Article 11.1 of the Articles of Association of RZZT CIC, the Directors of RZZT CIC delegate the powers enumerated in schedule 1 of this instrument to the Managing Director.

\section{Appointment of Managing Director}

  \item The Managing Director shall be appointed by the Directors after consultation with the Members.
  \item Notwithstanding subsection (1), the Directors may defer the decision to appoint the Managing Director to the Members.
  \item A decision made by the Members in accordance with subsection (2) shall be made by ordinary resolution.

    \item A person appointed as Managing Director shall remain a Director after they cease to be Managing Director, unless they otherwise cease to be a Director.

% This affords significant flexibility by ensuring the MD is privy to Director discussions and former Managing Directors can continue on lending their experience to the Directors and future Managing Directors.

        \item they otherwise cease to be a Director.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Directors must give the Managing Director 14 days' notice that they will cease to be the Managing Director, unless the reason for removal is misconduct, incompetence or criminality on the part of the Managing Director, as determined by the Directors.

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Directors' Reserve Power}

The Directors may direct the Managing Director to take, or refrain from taking, specific action.

\section{Further Delegation}
