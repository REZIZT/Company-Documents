# Accounts and reports

This is a summary of accounting and reporting requirements under the _Companies Act 2006_ (UK) c 46, pt 15. This document does not constitute legal advice.

## Small companies regime

A separate small companies regime applies to companies that qualify as small: s 381. A compan qualifies as a small company if, in its first financial year, its turnover does not exceed £10.2 million, its balance sheet total does not exceed £5.1 million, and its average number of employees does not exceed 50: s 382.

A company will continue to qualify as a small company if the qualifying conditions are met. A company will cease to qualify only if it fails to meet the qualifying conditions for two consecutive financial years. Likewise, a company will qualify if, having previously not met them, it meets the qualifying conditions for two consecutive financial years.

### Micro-entities

A company qualifies as a micro-entity if, in its first financial year, its turnover does not exceed £630 000, its balance sheet total does not exceed £316 000, and its average number of employees does not exceed 10: s 384A. A company will continue to qualify as a micro-entity if the qualifying conditions are met. A company will cease to qualify only if it fails to meet the qualifying conditions for two consecutive financial years. Likewise, a company will qualify if, having previously not met them, it meets the qualifying conditions for two consecutive financial years.

## Accounting

Every company must keep adequate accounting records that show and explain the company's transactions, disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the company, and enable the Directors to ensure accounts required to be prepared comply with the Act: s 386(1)--(2). Accounts must contain entries from day to day of all amounts received and expended and for what, and a record of the assets and liabilities of the company: s 386(3). If the company deals in goods the records must contain statements of stock held at the end of each financial year, stocktakings, and statements of all goods sold and purchased (except in ordinary retail trade) identifying the buyers and sellers: s 386(4).

Failure to comply with the duty to keep accounts is an offence committed by every officer of the company who is in default: s 387(1). It is a defence for a person charged to show that they acted honestly and that the circumstances made the default excusable: s 387(2). On conviction on indictment, a person is liable to imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or both: s 387(3)(a). On summary conviction, a person is liable for imprisonment for up to 12 months (England and Wales) or six months (Scotland and Northern Ireland), or a fine, or both: s 387(3)(b).

Accounting records must be kept at the company's registered office or at a place the directors think fit: s 388(1)(a). They must at all times be open to inspection by the company's officers: s 388(1)(b). If kept outside the United Kingdom, accounts and returns must be sent to, and kept at, a place in the United Kingdom where they are at all times open to inspection: s 388(2). Accounts and returns sent to the United Kingdom must disclose the financial position of the company at intervals not exceeding six months, and enable the directors to ensure that accounts required to be prepared comply with the requirements of the Act: s 188(3).

Failure to comply with these provisions is an offence committed by every officer of the company who is in default: s 389(1). It is a defence for a person charged to show that they acted honestly and that the circumstances made the default excusable: s 389(2). An officer also commits an offence if they fail to take all reasonable steps to ensure records are kept for the three year period or intentionally causes a default on that obligation: 389(3). 

Accounting records required under s 386 must be kept for three years from the date on which they are made: s 388(4). On conviction on indictment, a person is liable to imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or both: s 387(4)(a). On summary conviction, a person is liable for imprisonment for up to 12 months (England and Wales) or six months (Scotland and Northern Ireland), or a fine, or both: s 387(4)(b).

### Financial year

A company's first financial year begins with the first day of its first accounting reference period and ends not more than seven days before or after the end of that period: s 390(2). Subsequent financial years begin with the day immediately following the end of the company's previous financial year and end not more than seven days before or after the end of that period: s 390(3).

A company's accounting reference period is calculated according to its accounting reference date: s 391(1). The accounting reference date of a company registered after the commencement of the Act is the last day of the month in which the anniversary of its incorporation falls: s 391(4). A company's first accounting reference period is the period of more than six months but less than 18 months beginning on its date of incorporation and ending with its accounting reference date: s 391(5). Subsequent accounting reference periods are periods of 12 months beginning immediately after the end of the previous accounting reference period and ending with its accounting reference date: s 391(6). An accounting reference date may be changed under certain conditions: s 392.

### Annual accounts

Directors must not approve annual accounts unless satisied that the accounts give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company: s 393(1). A micro-entity's accounts should not include anything additional to this: s 393(1A). Accounts must be prepared for each financial year: s 394. Accounts may be prepared in accordance with the Companies Act regime ('Companies Act individual accounts') or international accounting standards ('IAS individual accounts'): s 395. This document considers only the Companies Act accounting regime.

Companies Act individual accounts must state the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered, the company's registered number, whether it is public or private, whether it is limited by shares or guarantee, and the address of the company's registered office: s 396(A1). Companies Act individual accounts must comprise a balance sheet as at the last day of the financial year, and a profit and a loss account: s 396(1). Accounts must given a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company as at the end of the financial year: s 396(2).
