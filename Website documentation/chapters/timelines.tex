\chapter{Timelines}

Timelines are a feature that can be used to illustrate the progress of something, such as the development of a project, the history of an organisation, or the progress toward a funding goal.

A page or post can include a timeline in its YAML frontmatter (refer to the previous chapters):

\begin{verbatim}
  ---
  layout: page
  title: "Project Name"
  permalink: "/project-name/"
  timeline:
    complete: false
    milestones:
    - milestone: "Milestone Description"
      date: YYYY-MM-DD
    - milestone: "Another Milestone Description"
      date: YYYY-MM-DD
  ---
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the timeline is not complete and so `false' is specified. If the timeline has completed (for example, the project has been finished) this should be replaced with `true'.

A timeline can be included anywhere in the body of the page or post using the following Liquid tag:

\begin{verbatim}
  {% include timeline.html %}
\end{verbatim}

Only one timeline per page or post is supported.
