\chapter{Data files}

Jekyll can use data files for various purposes. The Jekyll documentation for this feature is extensive and won't be explained here, but two data files are used to store information about RZZT's officers and positions vacant that should be explained.

\section{Officers}

The file \texttt{officers.yml} contains entries formatted as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  - role: "Director"
    surname: "Sem"
    forename: "Nibh"
    bio: "Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna."
\end{verbatim}
