\section{Special Resolution 2019-9: Appointment of Directors}

\textbf{Proposed by:} Neal Wright

\textbf{Resolution text}

The members of RZZT CIC resolve to amend Articles 23.3 and 23.4 of the Articles of Association to read:

\begin{framed}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{23.\arabic{enumi}}
    \item Subject to these articles, any person who is willing to act as a Director, and is permitted by law to do so, may be appointed to be a Director
    \begin{enumerate}
      \renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\alph{enumii})}
      \item by ordinary resolution; or
      \item by a decision of the Directors,
    \end{enumerate}
    but no more than 50\% of the Members may be Directors (``Member-Directors'') at the same time, reckoned according to the total number of members at the time of the most recent appointment of a Member as a Director.
    \item Subject to Article 23.3, in the event that ordinary resolutions are proposed that would, if all were passed, result in the appointment of more than 50\% of the Members as Directors, the Member-Directors shall be determined by an election in which all current and proposed Member-Directors shall be candidates, using a written and open optional-preferential ballot counted using the instant run-off method according to which:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\alph{enumii})}
      \item any candidate who has been ranked by at least 50\% of the votes cast shall be eligible to be appointed or remain as a Member-Director;
      \item each of the most preferred candidates shall be deemed to have been appointed as a Member-Director by ordinary resolution or shall remain as a Member-Director; and
      \item each of the remaining candidates shall be deemed to have been removed as a Member-Director by ordinary resolution or shall not be appointed as a Member-Director.
    \end{enumerate}
 \end{enumerate}
\end{framed}

\textbf{Explanation}

No explanation was provided. Members have the opportunity to discuss the resolution both before and during the general meeting.
