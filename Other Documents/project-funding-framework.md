# [DRAFT] Project Funding Framework

- The Directors shall, prior committing to funding the development of a project:
  - seek and receive the opinion of at least one person unconnected with the project who has relevant technical expertise with regard to the merits of the project; and
  - inform the members of the Company of any intention to fund the development of the project at least seven Clear Days' (as defined in the Articles of Association) in advance of committing to funding the development of the project ('the notification period').
- For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors may receive opinions from multiple people with relevant technical expertise, so long as each is unconnected with the project in question.
- If informed by the Directors of an intention to fund the development of a project, members may:
  - communicate their opinions to the Directors, or
  - require the Directors to call a general meeting at which a special resolution to exercise the members' reserve power to direct the Directors to refrain from committing to funding the project will be proposed.
- If a general meeting is called during the notification period, and the notice of that meeting states that a special resolution directing the Directors to refrain from committing to funding a project is to be proposed, the Directors must refrain from committing to funding the relevant project unless the resolution is defeated at the general meeting.
